To run the project:
./mvnw spring-boot:run to build and run

Project developed on Java 9, gave me some delightful issues with JAXB implementation

Project is built using Spring shell for CLI interactivity, allowing you to leverage tab complete and normal REPL functionality

Spring with JPA to connect to an in memory H2 database to persist users.

Considerations:
I did not implement the edit existing user functionality since I did not understand how it was supposed to function:

Pass a firstname and surname in and then what? Search by surname in the DB and change the firstname based on firstName input?
What about duplicate users with different ids? Since I was unsure I left it.

Unit tests: I created two unit tests to generate XML and consume it, this saves you manually building an XML file to test my functionality

Used maven for build, you can package as jar if you run 
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

The run as standalone jar with java -jar target/accela-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Help menu is fully interactive, you can type help to see all commands or drill down to see a specific command:
e.g. help add

If time permitted I would have written more unit tests around the add from xml file functionality.

I would also have removed spring boot and done manual wiring between spring shell and service/db classes. 
Spring Boot allowed me to get going very quickly however.
